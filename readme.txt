Thank you for agreeing to test the first complete (but none the less rough and ready...) version of GoCondcutor! Go into Documentation/using-goconductor for how to 'get started'. There's no strict/formal time period, any time you can spend over the next week or two is apreciated. I would not presume to ask for more than an hour or and hour and a half. 

go to https://users.sussex.ac.uk/haaa20/goconductor-docs/using-goconductor for the docs!

REMEMBER: this is user testing, so if (hopefully not) using GoConductor turns out to be confusing/frustrating to use, and if you find yourself unable to complete all or any of the tasks written above after a reasonable amount of time, please do not feel like you need to force yourself to keep working with it if you don't want to.

I will be in touch with a more formal, but brief, feedback form over the next week or so. Until then, just keep a note - mentally or otherwise - of your thoughts.

Thanks! 

Hugo

'Pixel Adventure' is a very simple demo with: a 2d platformer with a start screen, 2 characters you can switch between with the 'space' button, and enemy which perseus you over short distances, and, you will notice, no sound. You're testing task is to do the following:

*1 - EASY:
Have a unique theme song playing for each of the two characters when controlled by the player, and a third for the title screen. Be able to transition between each one.

*2 - MEDIUM:
Add functionality to the mute button on the heads up display. 

*3 - HARD:
Have each playable character's theme change when being chased by the enemy, by having a second track with added instrumentation overlap with it. The second track should be cued out again once the enemy is no longer chasing the player.

There are some short music loops included in the project. 'ebm' and 'tangerine' are comprised of two track designed to overlap in sync with each other (you may find this useful for part 3). It is the intention to have 'Mackie' as the main menu music and 'ebm' and 'tangerine' as character themes.
